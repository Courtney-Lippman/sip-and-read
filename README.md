## About The Project

Sip and Read is a dynamic application that displays an assortment of book and cocktail pairings for the user to view. Upon selecting a pairing, the user may explore the book and drink details such as its author, amazon link, drink ingredients, etc. This application was a showcase of all the knowledge I have gained with React, Router, and Cypress testing. On top of creating a complex and interactive application, I incorporated async JS concepts like fetching to an API and displaying proper error handling from the user and server side for a smoother user experience.

Sip and Read is a solo project that was completed on the 17th week at Turing School of Software Developer and Design. I was given 5 days to complete this project and it took me approximately 30 hours total to finish.

## Reflections

Sip and Read allowed me to challenge myself and apply the technology I have become familiar with over the last five weeks. Being able to research different APIs and develop my MVP based on a specific audience, I gained valuable knowledge about the product management process. I also was able to grow as a developer by applying React, Router, Asynch JS, and Cypress testing to the MVP that I created and creating the product in 5 days. Unexpected challenges arose  with asynch JS when I incorporated two APIs into my project; the confidence I built while I learned and solved those challenges was immense.
